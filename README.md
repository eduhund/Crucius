## About

Figma plugin for quick transformation of the geometry of images/objects/frames. 

## Problem

Figma cannot make three-dimensional images. Figma, as an editor, can only stretch, compress and rotate images.

Crucius is a mini preview so that you can quickly and cheaply transform images and get the result in the form of a raster image. The main thing is that it is quickly and done in one instrument - Figma.

## How Crucius works?

- search for a plugin in the figma plugin library or follow this [link](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1379456470658580472/crucius);
- run the plugin;
- select the object (frame) in Figma. P.S. anything can be in a frame;
- set the settings/parameters for transforming the content in the frame.
Each of the sliders is a CSS parameter that allows you to do whatever you want with the frame: compress, expand, rotate, reflect, stretch, etc.;
- make all necessary transformations with the object, and ask the plugin to return it back to the figma. export button;
- the plugin inserts this image back into the figma;
If you need a different perspective, do everything from the beginning: select an object, ask the plugin to pick it up and twist and turn until youâ€™re satisfied with the result.

All transformations support CSS. You can transform something directly in the plugin and get the result in CSS parameters format. So that the development, after inserting the original image and the selected parameters, gets the same result as the designers after all the transformations.

## Who are the Users?

- Designers of all types. Those who need to create a mockup during the design process or to show the product from different perspectives.

## Problems Crucius solves

1. There is no need to use similar third-party services (ex. Corel draw, AutoCAD), since the Crucius practically duplicates their functionality.
2. The ability to quickly see how the image transformation will look. The speed at which the result of these transformations appears in Figma.
3. Ease of tailoring the result to the task (endless creation of image impressions)

But there is a disadvantage of Crucius! The output is an uneditable raster image, which is very difficult to edit without losing quality.
